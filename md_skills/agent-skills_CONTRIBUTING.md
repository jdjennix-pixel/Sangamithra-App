## Creating New Skills

### Skill Structure

Each skill must follow this structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: Skill instructions and metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: Helper scripts
├── templates/        # Optional: Document templates
├── resources/        # Optional: Reference files
└── LICENSE.txt       # Optional: License file (if different from repo license)
```

### Skill Requirements

1. **SKILL.md** - Must contain:
   - YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
   - Clear instructions for AI assistants
   - Use cases and examples
   - Prerequisites and dependencies (if any)

2. **Naming Convention**:
   - Use kebab-case for skill folder names (e.g., `file-organizer`, `changelog-generator`)
   - Keep names descriptive and concise

3. **Documentation**:
   - Include clear "When to Use This Skill" section
   - Provide real-world examples
   - Document any required dependencies or setup

### Skill Best Practices

- **Focus on specific, repeatable tasks** - Skills should solve concrete problems
- **Include clear examples** - Show both basic and advanced use cases
- **Write for AI assistants** - Instructions should be clear for AI to follow
- **Test across platforms** - Ensure skills work with Command Code and other AI assistants
- **Document prerequisites** - List any required tools, APIs, or dependencies
- **Include error handling** - Guide AI on how to handle edge cases and errors
- **Follow coding standards** - Maintain code quality and best practices
