# Curation Guide

This is my keep pile.

I am not trying to mirror every agent skill on the internet. I want a strong set of skills I would actually keep on a machine, recommend, and keep improving.
Most of them come from other repos, so curation here is as much about provenance and trust as it is about the skill text.

## What I Care About

I want skills here to be:

- genuinely useful in real work
- clear enough that an agent can follow them well
- reusable across more than one project
- good enough to beat a generic prompt
- worth maintaining

If a skill does not clear that bar, I leave it out.

## What Usually Does Not Belong

- weak rewrites of skills that already exist here
- novelty skills that will feel dead in a month
- skills that are so narrow they are not worth maintaining
- skills with unclear attribution or licensing
- prompt dumps pretending to be skills

## How I Keep It Organized

I keep the folder structure simple and let the catalog do the sorting.

- `skills/` holds the actual skill folders
- `skills.json` is the catalog the CLI reads
- `workArea` and `branch` are the main browse fields in the catalog
- `work areas` are the main browse model
- `collections` are the shorter CLI shelves
- `category`, `tags`, `source`, `sourceUrl`, `origin`, `syncMode`, `featured`, `verified`, and `trust` help with sorting and trust

I do not want a deep folder tree. It makes install tooling worse and the repo harder to maintain.

## Work Areas And Collections

The main browse model is work area first, source repo second.

Collections are useful, but they are not meant to cover everything.

- `my-picks`: the fastest way to understand my taste
- `build-apps`: web and mobile product work with a high interface bar
- `build-systems`: backend, architecture, MCP, and deeper engineering work
- `test-and-debug`: review, QA, debugging, and cleanup work
- `docs-and-research`: docs, files, research, and execution support

Not every skill needs a collection. If something is useful but off to the side, search and tags can do the job.

## Featured And Verified

- `featured: true` means I would point people to that skill first
- `verified: true` means I have personally checked it and I am comfortable signaling more trust

Those markers should mean something. They should stay a little hard to earn.

## Trust Levels

- `listed` means the skill belongs in the library, but I am not signaling much beyond that yet
- `reviewed` means I have put a little more editorial weight behind it
- `verified` means I have personally checked it and I am comfortable standing behind it more directly

## Mirrors And Snapshots

- `mirror` means the local copy still tracks a clean upstream counterpart closely
- `snapshot` means I am intentionally shipping a stable vendored copy even if upstream has moved
- `adapted` means the library copy is based on outside work but changed enough that I do not want to pretend it is a straight mirror
- `authored` means I maintain the skill directly here

## Agent Support

I am keeping support focused on the major agents.

I do not want to spend time adding support for every new coding agent that launches, especially if I do not use it or do not think it will matter in six months.

If support is here, it should be worth the maintenance burden.

## Maintainer Workflow

When I add or update a skill, I try to answer these questions:

1. Is this actually good?
2. Does it belong here?
3. What is the right category?
4. Does it deserve a top-level shelf, or should it stay tag-driven?
5. Is it good enough to feature?
6. Have I checked enough to verify it?
7. Is the attribution clean?

## If This Turns Into A Website

The structure is already here.

- home page: library first, with work areas and source repos both visible
- browse page: collections, tags, source repos, and search
- skill page: source, tags, collections when relevant, install command
- trust layer: featured, verified, and catalog trust state

The repo should stay where the data lives. A site can present it better.
