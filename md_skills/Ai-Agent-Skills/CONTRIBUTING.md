# Contributing to AI Agent Skills

This repo is curated.

Most of the library is sourced from other repos, so attribution and provenance matter as much as the skill itself.

Before you open a PR, read [CURATION.md](./CURATION.md).

## Good Additions

A skill is a good fit when it is:

- clear about what it does and when to use it
- reusable in real workflows
- strong enough to beat a generic prompt
- well-structured and easy for an agent to follow
- properly attributed

If a skill is fine but does not add much, I would rather leave it out.

## Requirements

1. The skill must follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
2. `SKILL.md` must include valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`.
3. The skill name must be lowercase with hyphens only, for example `my-skill`.
4. The skill should actually work and provide value.
5. Your PR should explain why this deserves a place in the library.

## Process

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add the skill folder at `skills/<skill-name>/`.
3. Add or update the `skills.json` entry, including the right `workArea` and `branch`.
4. Keep the source repo, `sourceUrl`, and attribution clean.
5. Set the right trust level and sync mode. Most additions should start as `listed` and either `mirror` or `snapshot`.
6. Make sure the work area and tags are clean. Put the skill in a collection only if it clearly belongs on one of the shorter CLI shelves.
7. Run `node test.js`.
8. Open a PR with a short explanation of why it belongs.

## Categories

Use one of these:

- `development`
- `document`
- `creative`
- `business`
- `productivity`

## Collections

These are the top-level shelves:

- `my-picks`
- `build-apps`
- `build-systems`
- `test-and-debug`
- `docs-and-research`

Not every skill needs one. If tags and search do the job, say that in the PR.

## Review Bar

I review submissions for:

- usefulness
- clarity
- overlap with existing skills
- source quality and provenance
- attribution and licensing
- overall fit with the repo

## Updating Existing Skills

If you are improving a skill that is already here:

1. Keep attribution intact unless ownership has clearly changed.
2. Explain what you changed and why it is better.
3. Say whether it belongs on a top-level shelf, should become featured, or should become verified.

## Questions

If you are not sure whether something belongs, open an issue first. That is usually faster.
