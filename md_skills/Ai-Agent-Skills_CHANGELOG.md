# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [4.3.1] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Synced the upstream marketing-cli pack to `marketing-cli@0.5.4`. The `mktg` collection now ships 51 skills, with `mktg-setup` (first-run setup wizard), `postiz` (30+ social provider scheduling), `mktg-x` (authenticated X reader), `firecrawl` (web scraping and search), and `summarize` (text TL;DR) added to the catalog.

### Changed
- Renamed the upstream marketing pack source from `MoizIbnYousaf/mktg` to `MoizIbnYousaf/marketing-cli` across catalog metadata, install sources, and source URLs.
- Refreshed README and `WORK_AREAS.md` so the bundled library stats (115 skills, 17 house copies, 98 cataloged upstream) reflect the synced catalog.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Private-library bootstrap and import flows built into the normal workspace system, including current-directory `init-library`, custom shelves, and bulk import.
- Better import reporting with invalid-name skips, duplicate reporting, fallback-to-`workflow` visibility, and stronger JSON summaries.
- A new `marketing` shelf in the bundled library plus the upstream `mktg` marketing pack from `MoizIbnYousaf/marketing-cli`, with `mktg` and `marketing-cli` shortcut installs.

### Changed
- Improved private-library import quality with stronger auto-classification, better default `whyHere` notes, and steadier branch grouping for imported skills.
- Updated README, workflow docs, and release notes so the published surface matches the 4.3.0 package state.

### Fixed
- Stopped invalid private-only skill names from aborting whole import batches.
- Kept local/private imported skills readable across preview, info, install, and TUI flows without synthesizing bogus upstream URLs.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Remote shared-library installs that detect managed workspaces, expose parseable `--list` and `--dry-run` output, and resolve house copies plus upstream picks from one install flow.
- Authored workflow skills for `audit-library-health`, `browse-and-evaluate`, `build-workspace-docs`, `migrate-skills-between-libraries`, `review-a-skill`, and `update-installed-skills`.
- Wider machine-readable command support with JSON schemas, stdin mutation input, field masks, pagination, and dry-run coverage across more workflows.

### Changed
- Refined the shared-library story around team curation, shelf-first browsing, and a stronger "for your agent" handoff protocol.
- Tightened remote install errors and dry-run plans so non-interactive use stays predictable and actionable.
- Updated the README and curator-facing docs so the public surface matches the 4.2.0 library-manager state.

### Fixed
- Corrected shared-library dependency resolution so house copies install from the library while upstream entries keep their own recorded source.
- Hardened preview and install surfaces against suspicious content and invalid path-style inputs.
- Preserved workspace installs after workspace moves and improved unavailable-source messaging when a shared library can no longer be found.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Managed workspace mode with `.ai-agent-skills/config.json` and `init-library` scaffolding.
- The `add` command for bringing bundled picks, upstream repo skills, and house copies into a workspace library.
- The `build-docs` command for regenerating workspace `README.md` and `WORK_AREAS.md`.
- Dependency-aware catalog installs with `requires` and `--no-deps`.
- A shared install-state index used by the CLI and TUI.
- An `Installed` top-level TUI view and an empty-workspace onboarding state.
- Authored workflow guides for starting a library, adding upstream skills, making house copies, organizing shelves, and refreshing installs.

### Changed
- Promoted `sync` to the primary refresh command and kept `update` as a compatibility alias.
- Routed CLI and TUI library reads through active library resolution, so commands now follow bundled mode or workspace mode based on the current directory.
- Reframed the README and package surface around `ai-agent-skills` as a library manager, not only the bundled curated library.
- Split the README quick start into bundled-library and managed-workspace flows.

### Fixed
- Restored installed workspace catalog skills after workspace moves when commands run inside the relocated workspace.
- Tightened the npm publish surface so only workflow docs ship from `docs/`.
- Enforced duplicate-dependency validation for `requires`.
- Preserved explicit GitHub refs when cataloged upstream skills are stored as install metadata.

## [3.4.3] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- Changed the default TUI opening view back to the boxed shelf and source grid so `ai-agent-skills` lands directly on the card-based library browser instead of the poster-text lead view.
- Restored the focused home inspector under the grid so the opening screen keeps the richer shelf/source preview while staying in the boxed layout.

### Removed
- Removed the temporary poster-home renderer and its compact-visibility helper now that the boxed library view is the default again.

## [3.4.2] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- Tightened the TUI home into a stronger shelf-first poster layout with one dominant lead shelf or source and quieter neighboring picks below it.
- Replaced the last internal `atlas` wording in the TUI with consistent `library`, `shelves`, and `sources` language.

### Fixed
- Fixed TUI boot so the library opens from the top of the terminal pane instead of landing partway down the first screen.
- Removed the startup/loading card from the initial TUI frame so the first visible render is the actual library, not a boot placeholder.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- Simplified the TUI to the two real browse modes, `Shelves` and `Sources`, so the library opens directly into the taxonomy instead of a separate home summary.
- Renamed the overlapping frontend lanes to `Frontend (Anthropic)` and `Frontend (OpenAI)` so the publisher distinction is obvious while browsing.
- Tightened shelf and source cards with more editorial copy and less filler metadata so the first scan feels more like a library and less like a dashboard.
- Restored the README note that this repo launched before `skills.sh` and began as a universal installer before becoming a personal curated library.

### Fixed
- Corrected the source card footer pluralization in the TUI (`shelves`, not `shelfs`).

## [3.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Added a first-class `curate` command for editing shelf placement, editorial notes, tags, labels, trust, verification state, and removals without hand-editing `skills.json`.
- Added a shared catalog mutation engine so CLI cataloging, curator edits, vendoring, and generated docs all run through the same validation and write path.
- Added generated-doc rendering with drift checks for `README.md` and `WORK_AREAS.md`, plus an internal `render:docs` maintenance script.
- Added a TUI curator loop with inline overlays for reviewing the library, editing the focused skill, and adding new upstream picks from GitHub repos.

### Changed
- Locked normal intake to upstream-only behavior: `catalog` now accepts GitHub repos, requires full shelf placement, and refuses partial or blank editorial entries.
- Tightened `vendor` into the explicit house-copy path, with the same editorial metadata requirements as the upstream catalog flow.
- Renamed the two overlapping frontend lanes so they read by publisher: `Frontend (Anthropic)` and `Frontend (OpenAI)`.
- Simplified the TUI to the two real browse modes, `Shelves` and `Sources`, with the old home summary removed from the top-level navigation.
- Rewrote shelf and source lane cards with more editorial copy and less generic metadata filler so the first scan reads like a curated library, not a utility dashboard.
- Synced the README and work-area map from the catalog so shelf counts and tables stop drifting.
- Restored the README note that this repo launched before `skills.sh` and started life as a universal installer before becoming a personal skills library.

### Removed
- Removed `figma-implement-design` from the curated library and the frontend shelf.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- Reworked the TUI home into a poster-style shelf browser with one dominant lead block, quieter neighboring shelves, and calmer chrome across the header, tabs, and footer.
- Reordered skill detail screens so the editorial note leads before install actions, with provenance and neighboring shelf picks kept visible without crowding the first frame.
- Polished `list` and `info` so the CLI reads like the same curated library as the TUI instead of a diagnostic catalog dump.

### Fixed
- Restored bundled `SKILL.md` loading in the TUI catalog so vendored skills can actually show real preview content again.
- Tightened the publish surface with an explicit npm `files` allowlist so temporary live-test reports and other local artifacts do not leak into the package tarball.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Added explicit `tier`, `distribution`, `notes`, and `labels` support to the catalog model.
- Added three new OpenAI skills: `figma-implement-design`, `security-best-practices`, and `notion-spec-to-implementation`.
- Added regression coverage for nested upstream installs, update-after-install, sparse upstream dry runs, and explicit tier metadata.
- Added a no-mock live verification suite that clones real upstream repos, captures raw source snapshots, exercises install/update/uninstall flows, and smoke-tests the TUI through a PTY.

### Changed
- Reframed the library around 10 shelves and rebuilt the collections around the current catalog.
- Normalized upstream install sources to exact repo subpaths so single-skill installs can use sparse checkout.
- Redesigned the CLI list output and TUI home around the bookshelf model instead of a flat catalog view.
- Rewrote the README, work-area map, and changelog to match the current two-tier architecture.
- Bumped the package and catalog version to `3.2.0`.

### Fixed
- Fixed nested upstream installs for cataloged skills such as `frontend-skill`, `shadcn`, and `emil-design-eng`.
- Fixed upstream installs so `update` works immediately after install with normalized `.skill-meta.json` metadata.
- Fixed TUI scope installs so upstream skills install correctly in both global and project scopes.
- Fixed project-scope lifecycle commands so `list --installed`, `update`, and `uninstall` now work against `.agents/skills/`, not only legacy agent targets.
- Fixed `preview` so upstream skills no longer print a false "not found" error before showing the fallback preview.
- Fixed root-skill renaming so local root skills keep their frontmatter name instead of inheriting a temp directory name.
- Fixed the TUI skill screen so upstream skills without bundled markdown no longer crash when opened from search.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Introduced the two-tier library model: house copies plus cataloged upstream skills.
- Added the `catalog` command for curating skills from GitHub repos without vendoring them.

### Changed
- Reduced the library from the older 48-skill set to a tighter curated shelf of 33 skills.
- Shifted the product from a generic installer toward an editorial library with provenance, trust, and `whyHere` notes.
